# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by newer versions or is no longer relevant to the current system architecture.

## Archived Files

### `sqlproblem.md` (Archived: 2025-01-01)
**Original Issue Date:** September 21, 2025
**Status:** Resolved through Repository Pattern migration
**Reason for Archiving:** The SQLModel compatibility problems described in this document have been systematically resolved through the implementation of the Repository Pattern with feature flags and shadow comparison.

**Key Problems That Were Solved:**
- BaseTableModel vs. Database schema discrepancies
- Model definition inconsistencies and duplicates
- Raw SQL workarounds
- HTMX endpoint issues
- Session management problems

**Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive Repository Pattern with type-safe data access, feature flags for safe migration, and shadow comparison for A/B testing.

### `FIXES_DOCUMENTATION.md` (Archived: 2025-01-01)
**Original Issue Date:** September 22, 2025
**Status:** Historical record of system restoration
**Reason for Archiving:** This document describes emergency fixes that restored the system from 4.4% to 95% health. These fixes have been superseded by the new Repository Pattern architecture.

**Key Historical Fixes:**
- PostgreSQL schema synchronization
- Circular import resolution
- SQLAlchemy conflicts resolution
- Feed system recovery
- Frontend accessibility restoration

**Resolution:** The underlying architectural issues have been fundamentally resolved through the Repository Pattern implementation.

## Current Documentation

For current system documentation, see:

- **`README.md`** - Main project overview with Repository Pattern architecture
- **`DEVELOPER_SETUP.md`** - Complete development environment setup
- **`TESTING.md`** - Testing strategies including repository migration testing
- **`MONITORING.md`** - Feature flags and monitoring guide
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Project configuration with code quality tools

## Migration Path

The system has evolved from:

1. **Raw SQL + SQLModel Hybrid** (problematic, documented in archived files)
2. **Emergency Raw SQL Workarounds** (temporary fixes, documented in archived files)
3. **Repository Pattern + Feature Flags** (current architecture, documented in main docs)

The Repository Pattern provides:
- Type-safe data access with SQLAlchemy Core
- Feature flags for safe gradual rollout
- Shadow comparison for A/B testing
- Performance monitoring with automatic fallback
- Clean separation of concerns

## Historical Context

These archived documents provide valuable context about:
- Technical debt that was accumulated
- Emergency recovery procedures that were needed
- Decision-making process that led to the Repository Pattern
- Lessons learned about SQLModel hybrid architectures

They remain available for reference but should not be used as current implementation guidance.
